#Kotlin Try out
A sample project featuring my first attempt at Kotlin and some of its goodies.

---

## Features
* Retrofit for network requests.
* RxJava2 for coolness.
* Room for database.
* Koin for dependency injection.
* ViewModels and LiveData.
* ViewStateAdapter - an attempt to have a simple plug'n'play solution for custom list operations (Work in progress)

---

## Stuff that is missing
* Coroutines - short on time and too accustomed to Rx to try this out.
* Sealed classes - ViewState could be represented as a Sealed class, but there were some limitations.
* Higher-Order functions
* Unit tests
